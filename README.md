# DNSCrypt-android

Basic DNSCrypt client for Android, still a beta. Should work with any android 4.4+ devices but lot of public wifi in companies and all 3G/4G connections forbid to query others DNS so it's normal if it's doesn't work everywhere.
Use the code as you want, it's not currently maintained as I wanted to use this in public places
